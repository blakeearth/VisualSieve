# VisualSieve
This project is a simple visual quadratic sieve for catching primes. It's made with [Processing](https://processing.org/), a language and IDE built on Java designed to make it easier to code and draw with code.

## Usage
### Jarfile
To run this visualization, download and execute the jarfile associated with the most recent release (see the [releases page](https://github.com/blakeearth/VisualSieve/releases/)). Read the notes for the version; you might need to install a JDK.

### Processing
If you would rather run the visualization in Processing, download [Processing](https://processing.org/) and the source code associated with the most recent release (see the [releases page](https://github.com/blakeearth/VisualSieve/releases/)). Extract the source code and open a `.pde` file in the resulting folder to open the Sketch. Then, press the play icon to run.
